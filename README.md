# üñ•Ô∏è **Mega Project: Baremetal Kubernetes Cluster for Game Servers and DevOps Automation** üéÆ      
 
Welcome to the **Mega Project: Kubernetes Cluster for Game Servers and DevOps Automation** project! üöÄ

This project focuses on deploying a fully functional **baremetal Kubernetes cluster** optimized for hosting **Minecraft servers** and other containerized applications. Through this project, we integrate modern DevOps tools and practices, including **GitOps automation** via **GitLab CI/CD pipelines**, **security scanning** with **Trivy**, **performance monitoring** using **Prometheus and Grafana**, and **persistent storage management** with **Rook/Ceph**.

We take Kubernetes to the next level by enhancing the cluster's **scalability**, **security**, and **observability**, using cutting-edge tools such as **Ingress Controllers**, **Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPA)**, **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, and a **Service Mesh** like **Istio*.

## üåü **Key Features**:
- **Scalable Kubernetes Cluster** on physical hardware for optimal game server hosting.
- **GitOps Automation** with a fully automated CI/CD pipeline powered by **GitLab**.
- **Automated Image Security** using **Trivy** for vulnerability scanning.
- **Cluster Monitoring** with **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for real-time observability.
- **Persistent Storage Management** via **Rook/Ceph**.
- **Traffic Management & Security** using **Ingress Controllers** and **RBAC**.
- **Dynamic Scaling** with **Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPA)**.
- **Service Mesh Integration** using **Istio** for network observability and security.

Whether you're a seasoned DevOps engineer or a Kubernetes enthusiast, this project provides valuable insights into managing complex, high-performance applications at scale, with a focus on gaming and cloud-native technologies. üåê

### üìÇ **Project Structure**:
The project is organized into distinct steps for easier navigation and setup. Each step corresponds to a different aspect of the Kubernetes cluster management:

1. **Baremetal Kubernetes Cluster Setup**:
    - Deploy the Kubernetes cluster on physical hardware.
    - Install necessary components (kubeadm, kubectl, networking).
    - Set up HAProxy for load balancing.

2. **GitOps Automation with GitLab**:
    - Configure GitLab for CI/CD automation.
    - Set up pipelines for building, security scanning, and deploying Docker images.

3. **Image Security Automation**:
    - Integrate **Trivy** into GitLab pipelines for container vulnerability scanning.
    - Define vulnerability thresholds and implement alerts.

4. **Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana**:
    - Install **Prometheus** and **Grafana** using Helm.
    - Configure custom dashboards for real-time monitoring.

5. **Persistent Storage with Rook/Ceph**:
    - Set up **Rook** and **Ceph** for reliable and scalable storage.
    - Create **Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)** for game server data.

6. **Ingress Controllers for Traffic Management**:
    - Deploy the **NGINX Ingress Controller**.
    - Set up routing rules for managing traffic to various services.

7. **Dynamic Scaling with Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPA)**:
    - Enable **Metrics Server** for monitoring resource usage.
    - Configure **HPA** for dynamic scaling of Minecraft servers based on resource usage.

8. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
    - Define **RBAC** policies to manage user roles and permissions.
    - Create role-based access rules to secure the cluster.

9. **Service Mesh Integration with Istio**:
    - Install **Istio** for enhanced traffic management and security.
    - Enable **mTLS** for secure service-to-service communication.

10. **Deployment of Minecraft Game Servers**:
    - Containerize **Minecraft** servers and deploy them as **StatefulSets** in Kubernetes.
    - Set up automatic scaling and persistence for game data.
